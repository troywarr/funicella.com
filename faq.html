          <p>If you are a <strong>new patient</strong>, please plan to be here at least 15 minutes before your scheduled appointment time so that we can gather all necessary information for your patient file. We encourage you to <a href="patient_forms.html">download and complete these forms</a> prior to your visit.</p>
          <p>If you are an <strong>established patient</strong>, please allow 10 minutes before your appointment time as we may need to ask for some information to update your medical records.</p>
          <h2 id="faq11">What should I bring to my appointment?</h2>
          <p class="p_above_ul">Please be sure to bring:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>your insurance card;</li>
            <li>a photo ID such as your driver's license;</li>
            <li>and, your checkbook or cash (we do not accept credit or debit cards) to cover any charges that you may incur.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We will also need to collect basic demographic information, information about your medical history, and a list of current medications (prescription and over-the-counter).</p>
          <p>We encourage <strong>new patients</strong> to <a href="patient_forms.html">download and complete these forms</a> prior to your appointment. This ensures that you are aware of all information that we need in advance of your visit.</p>
          <h2 id="faq12">What is the parking situation like at your office?</h2>
          <p>We are the only occupied office suite in our building, so there is plenty of adjacent parking throughout the day. We also have parking for the disabled and an access ramp directly in front of our office.</p>
